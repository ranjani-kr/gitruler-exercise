# GitRuler Section E

This repository is section C of the [GitRuler exercises](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-exercises). If you do not already have a your own repository for these exercises [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). 

In this exercise we will learn about branching and merging.

## Branching and working within a branch

1. Run GitRuler to initialise the exercise.
1. [Create a new branch](https://githowto.com/creating_a_branch) in this repository called `new-location-1` from `master`.
2. In the `new-location-1` branch add "Sunny Rosario" to a new line in `files/employees.txt`. Commit that change with the message "Add employee Sunny"
3. [Switch back to](https://githowto.com/navigating_branches) the `master` branch add a new file called `files/products.txt` containing "Bananas". Commit this file with the message "Add products file".
4. [Merge all changes](https://githowto.com/merging) from the `master` branch into the `new-location-1` branch.
5. Merge all changes from the `new-location-1` branch into the `master` branch.

## Submitting the results

Once the exercise is complete, push this repository to the remote. If there are multiple branches for an exercise, make sure that you push them all. 

To ensure that you have you correctly pushed everything that you need to, you could clone the remote repository into a separate folder and re-run gitruler.
